# NextWeatherApp
This Weather App allows the user to search for any location to see the current weather as well as other useful information such as humidity and wind speed. This information is fetched using [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/). The main purpose for creating this project was to gain experience using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, as well as component libraries such as daisyUI.
